            <p>That this strange mix would resonate with moviegoers was never a given. In 1974, the record producer Lou Adler moved the show from London to Hollywood (adding Meat Loaf to the cast). There was also a brief Broadway bid. The show finally returned to a Gothic castle in Britain to become a movie (directed by Jim Sharman, who also directed the stage version) once Mr. Adler cut a deal with 20th Century Fox.

The cast included Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon after the studio demanded that Americans play Brad and Janet. But Mr. Curry was allowed to reprise his stage role, complete with leather jacket, fishnets and heels. “He’s the ultimate seducer,” Mr. Curry said of Frank. “Everyone is a potential target.”

Mr. Adler recalled believing in the movie when few else did. Early on, Fox’s European marketing executives were invited to watch the filming of the climactic swimming pool scene. “There was dead silence,” he said. “They didn’t stay for lunch.”</p>
